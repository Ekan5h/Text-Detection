## Note
- IMPORTANT: Due to submission size constraint, we could not place the model weights in our submission. To test our codes, please download both files from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1usbxrYInWK9GN-yPzjaNf1dzT1QkgRpq?usp=sharing, and place it in `Overall Pipeline`. Then you can follow the sample commands in that directory's README to test our code.
- Our project has been described in detail in `presentation.pptx`. This presentation has audio recordings as well. Please view using Microsoft Office.
- The trained model weights have been removed from the CRNN and PixelLink directories to save memory. For individual functionality, copy:
	- `Overall Pipeline/pixellink.h5` and place it in `PixelLink/weights` 
	- `Overall Pipeline/CRNN.h5` and place it in `CRNN/model`
- Usage and a couple of sample commands have been provided in `Overall Pipeline/README.md`
